<h2>Overview</h2>
Rocketstat is essentially a copy of the <a href=https://github.com/kgorman/mongostat>original</a> python 'mongostat' utility written by Kenny Gorman in 2010, however it's designed to utilize the <a href=http://www.objectrocket.com>ObjectRocket</a> public API as a data source.  The functionality should roughly mirror the 10gen utility called 'mongostat' where it makes sense.  Some stats don't translate to the ObjectRocket cloud service and thus are omitted.  A guideline of the values reported can be found in the <a href=http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongostat/>10gen docs</a>.

Requires: <a href=http://www.python.org/>python</a>, <a href=http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>pymongo</a>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
	In order to use rocketstat you will need an ObjectRocket API Key.  You will need to signup for a <a href=http://www.objectrocket.com>Objectrocket account</a>, create an instance, then select the API tab under your instance.  Copy/Paste the API key to the command line below.
<p>
	Rocketstat reports aggregate stats across your entire instance.  That means that your data is summated across all the shards.  You are seeing total overall statistics about your MongoDB instance on ObjectRocket.
